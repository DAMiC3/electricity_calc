## App Icon Rebranding Limitation

**Question:** Is the app icon rebranding limitation a decision we're making or a risk we're taking?

**Context:** App icons cannot be changed dynamically after installation - they require a new app build and app store update.

**Current Approach:** 
- We'll add a disclaimer above the logo changing option in the admin panel
- Rebranding won't happen often, so this limitation is acceptable

**Status:** Need to decide if this is a conscious design choice or a technical limitation we need to work around.
